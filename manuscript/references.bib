  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Lassa virus (LASV), the cause of the acute viral
              hemorrhagic illness Lassa fever (LF), is endemic in West Africa.
              Infections in humans occur mainly after exposure to infected
              excrement or urine of the rodent-host, Mastomys natalensis. The
              prevalence of exposure to LASV in Sierra Leone is crudely
              estimated and largely unknown. This cross-sectional study aimed to
              establish a baseline point seroprevalence of IgG antibodies to
              LASV in three administrative districts of Sierra Leone and
              identify potential risk factors for seropositivity and LASV
              exposure. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Between 2015 and
              2018, over 10,642 participants from Kenema, Tonkolili, and Port
              Loko Districts were enrolled in this cross-sectional study.
              Previous LASV and LF epidemiological studies support
              classification of these districts as ``endemic,'' ``emerging,''
              and ``non-endemic'', respectively. Dried blood spot samples were
              tested for LASV antibodies by ELISA to determine the
              seropositivity of participants, indicating previous exposure to
              LASV. Surveys were administered to each participant to assess
              demographic and environmental factors associated with a higher
              risk of exposure to LASV. Overall seroprevalence for antibodies to
              LASV was 16.0\%. In Kenema, Port Loko, and Tonkolili Districts,
              seroprevalences were 20.1\%, 14.1\%, and 10.6\%, respectively. In
              a multivariate analysis, individuals were more likely to be LASV
              seropositive if they were living in Kenema District, regardless of
              sex, age, or occupation. Environmental factors contributed to an
              increased risk of LASV exposure, including poor housing
              construction and proximity to bushland, forested areas, and
              refuse. CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: In this study we determine a
              baseline LASV seroprevalence in three districts which will inform
              future epidemiological, ecological, and clinical studies on LF and
              the LASV in Sierra Leone. The heterogeneity of the distribution of
              LASV and LF over both space, and time, can make the design of
              efficacy trials and intervention programs difficult. Having more
              studies on the prevalence of LASV and identifying potential
              hyper-endemic areas will greatly increase the awareness of LF and
              improve targeted control programs related to LASV.",

               West Africa. The reservoir host of the virus is a multimammate
               rat, Mastomys natalensis. Prevalence estimates of Lassa virus
               antibodies in humans vary greatly between studies, and the main
               modes of transmission of the virus from rodents to humans remain
               unclear. We aimed to (i) estimate the prevalence of Lassa
               virus-specific IgG antibodies (LV IgG) in the human population of
               a rural area of Guinea, and (ii) identify risk factors for
               positive LV IgG. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A population-based
               cross-sectional study design was used. In April 2000, all
               individuals one year of age and older living in three prefectures
               located in the tropical secondary forest area of Guinea
               (Gueckedou, Lola and Yomou) were sampled using two-stage cluster
               sampling. For each individual identified by the sampling
               procedure and who agreed to participate, a standardized
               questionnaire was completed to collect data on personal exposure
               to potential risk factors for Lassa fever (mainly contact with
               rodents), and a blood sample was tested for LV IgG. A multiple
               logistic regression model was used to determine risk factors for
               positive LV IgG. A total of 1424 subjects were interviewed and
               977 sera were tested. Prevalence of positive LV Ig was of 12.9\%
               [10.8\%-15.0\%] and 10.0\% [8.1\%-11.9\%] in rural and urban
               areas, respectively. Two risk factors of positive LV IgG were
               identified: to have, in the past twelve months, undergone an
               injection (odds ratio [OR] = 1.8 [1.1-3.1]), or lived with
               someone displaying a haemorrhage (OR = 1.7 [1.1-2.9]). No factors
               related to contacts with rats and/or mice remained statistically
               significant in the multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Our study
               underlines the potential importance of person-to-person
               transmission of Lassa fever, via close contact in the same

               caught in the wild in various regions of West Africa. The ELISA
               reached an accuracy of 97.1\% in samples of known exposure, and a
               comparison to an immunofluorescence assay (IFA) revealed a very
               strong agreement between the ELISA and IFA results (Cohen's kappa

Human exposure hinges significantly on LASV ecology, which is in turn shaped by various parameters such as weather seasonality and even virus and rodent-host genetics. Furthermore, human behaviour, despite playing a key role in the zoonotic nature of the disease, critically affects either the spread or control of human-to-human transmission. Previous estimations on LF burden date from the 80s and it is unclear how the population expansion and the improvement on diagnostics and surveillance methods have affected such predictions. Although recent data have contributed to the awareness of epidemics, the real impact of LF in West African communities will only be possible with the intensification of interdisciplinary efforts in research and public health approaches. This review discusses the causes and consequences of LF from a One Health perspective, and how the application of this concept can improve the surveillance and control of this disease in West Africa.},

Thus far, the available literature does not describe the sampling of feces as a means to detect LASV in M. natalensis populations. More evidence is needed to know if feces of naturally infected M. natalensis can be LASV-positive and an exposure risk to humans. This study sampled feces deposits in households from three villages in the LASV-endemic region of Faranah, Guinea. PCR analysis found 10 out of 88 samples to be positive for LASV, and sequencing showed clustering to previously identified Yarawelia and Dalafilani strains.

Spillover to humans occurs frequently and results in Lassa fever, a viral haemorrhagic fever (VHF) associated with a high case fatality rate. Despite advances, fundamental gaps in knowledge of the immunology, epidemiology, ecology and pathogenesis of Lassa fever persist. More frequent outbreaks, the potential for further geographic expansion of Mastomys natalensis and other rodent reservoirs, the ease of procurement and possible use and weaponization of LASV, the frequent importation of LASV to North America and Europe, and the emergence of novel LASV strains in densely populated West Africa have driven new initiatives to develop countermeasures for LASV. Although promising candidates are being evaluated, as yet there are no approved vaccines or therapeutics for human use. This Review discusses the virology of LASV, the clinical course of Lassa fever and the progress towards developing medical countermeasures.},

  abstract = {Forecasting the risk of pathogen spillover from reservoir populations of wild or domestic animals is essential for the effective deployment of interventions such as wildlife vaccination or culling. Due to the sporadic nature of spillover events and limited availability of data, developing and validating robust, spatially explicit, predictions is challenging. Recent efforts have begun to make progress in this direction by capitalizing on machine learning methodologies. An important weakness of existing approaches, however, is that they generally rely on combining human and reservoir infection data during the training process and thus conflate risk attributable to the prevalence of the pathogen in the reservoir population with the risk attributed to the realized rate of spillover into the human population. Because effective planning of interventions requires that these components of risk be disentangled, we developed a multi-layer machine learning framework that separates these processes. Our approach begins by training models to predict the geographic range of the primary reservoir and the subset of this range in which the pathogen occurs. The spillover risk predicted by the product of these reservoir specific models is then fit to data on realized patterns of historical spillover into the human population. The result is a geographically specific spillover risk forecast that can be easily decomposed and used to guide effective intervention. Applying our method to Lassa virus, a zoonotic pathogen that regularly spills over into the human population across West Africa, results in a model that explains a modest but statistically significant portion of geographic variation in historical patterns of spillover. When combined with a mechanistic mathematical model of infection dynamics, our spillover risk model predicts that 897,700 humans are infected by Lassa virus each year across West Africa, with Nigeria accounting for more than half of these human infections.},

Mitochondrial phylogenetics indicate this species was fragmented during the Pleistocene, forming six matrilineage phylogroups: A-I, A-II, A-III, B-IV, B-V, B-VI with distinct ranges. All except the A-III lineage are identified as natural reservoirs of mammarenaviruses. M. natalensis A-III is found in western Ethiopia and is the only lineage reported in the country. While screening 203 small mammal samples from Dhati Welel National Park for mammarenaviruses, we detected mammarenavirus RNA in nine samples, eight from M. natalensis and one from M. awashensis. A sequence similarity search and phylogenetic analysis confirmed the M. natalensis mitochondrial DNA belongs to the A-III lineage. We characterised the complete virus genome, which showed typical mammarenavirus organisation. Phylogenetic analysis indicated it clusters with Gairo virus found in M. natalensis B-IV in Tanzania, while showing sufficient divergence from other mammarenaviruses to be considered as a new species, for which we proposed the name Dhati Welel. Additional sampling in the M. natalensis A-III phylogeographic range should help determine whether the detection of the virus in M. awashensis represents a local spill-over or if the virus circulates in both Mastomys species.},

Here we analyze viral RNA levels in body fluids, virus titers in organs and antibody presence in blood. In adults and 2-week-old animals, LASV causes transient infections with subsequent seroconversion. However, mice younger than two weeks exhibit persistent infections lasting up to 16 months despite antibody presence. LASV can be detected in various body fluids, organs, and cell types, primarily in lung, kidney, and gonadal epithelial cells. Despite the systemic virus presence, no pathological alterations in organs are observed. Infected animals efficiently transmit the virus throughout their lives. Our findings underscore the crucial role of persistently infected individuals, particularly infected females and their progeny, in LASV dissemination within the host population.},

  abstract = {The Natal multimammate mouse (Mastomys natalensis) is the reservoir host of Lassa virus (LASV), an arenavirus that causes Lassa haemorrhagic fever in humans in West Africa. While previous studies suggest that spillover risk is focal within rural villages due to the spatial behaviour of the rodents, the level of clustering was never specifically assessed. Nevertheless, detailed information on the spatial distribution of infected rodents would be highly valuable to optimize LASV-control campaigns, which are limited to rodent control or interrupting human--rodent contact considering that a human vaccine is not available. Here, we analysed data from a four-year field experiment to investigate whether LASV-infected rodents cluster in households in six rural villages in Guinea. Our analyses were based on the infection status (antibody or PCR) and geolocation of rodents (n = 864), and complemented with a phylogenetic analysis of LASV sequences (n = 119). We observed that the majority of infected rodents were trapped in a few houses (20\%) and most houses were rodent-free at a specific point in time (60\%). We also found that LASV strains circulating in a specific village were polyphyletic with respect to neighbouring villages, although most strains grouped together at the sub-village level and persisted over time. In conclusion, our results suggest that: (i) LASV spillover risk is heterogeneously distributed within villages in Guinea; (ii) viral elimination in one particular village is unlikely if rodents are not controlled in neighbouring villages. Such spatial information should be incorporated into eco-epidemiological models that assess the cost-efficiency of LASV control strategies.},

It is an important endemic zoonotic disease in West Africa with growing evidence for increasing frequency and sizes of outbreaks. Phylogeographic and molecular epidemiology methods have projected expansion of the Lassa fever endemic zone in the context of future global change. The Natal multimammate mouse (             Mastomys natalensis             ) is the predominant LASV reservoir, with few studies investigating the role of other animal species. To explore host sequencing biases, all LASV nucleotide sequences and associated metadata available on GenBank (n = 2,298) were retrieved. Most data originated from Nigeria (54\%), Guinea (20\%) and Sierra Leone (14\%). Data from non-human hosts (n = 703) were limited and only 69 sequences encompassed complete genes. We found a strong positive correlation between the number of confirmed human cases and sequences at the country level (             r             = 0.93 (95\% Confidence Interval = 0.71 - 0.98),             p             {$<$} 0.001) but no correlation exists between confirmed cases and the number of available rodent sequences (             r             = -0.019 (95\% C.I. -0.71 - 0.69),             p =             0.96). Spatial modelling of sequencing effort highlighted current biases in locations of available sequences, with increased effort observed in Southern Guinea and Southern Nigeria. Phylogenetic analyses showed geographic clustering of LASV lineages, suggestive of isolated events of human-to-rodent transmission and the emergence of currently circulating strains of LASV from the year 1498 in Nigeria. Overall, the current study highlights significant geographic limitations in LASV surveillance, particularly, in non-human hosts. Further investigation of the non-human reservoir of LASV, alongside expanded surveillance, are required for precise characterisation of the emergence and dispersal of LASV. Accurate surveillance of LASV circulation in non-human hosts is vital to guide early detection and initiation of public health interventions for future Lassa fever outbreaks.},

  abstract = {The arenavirus Lassa is found in West Africa, where it sometimes causes a severe illness called Lassa fever. Lassa fever has been seldom investigated outside of a few hyperendemic regions, where the described epidemiology may differ from that in areas of low or moderate incidence of disease. Through a prospective cohort study, we investigated the epidemiology and clinical presentation of Lassa fever in Guinea, where the disease has been infrequently recognized. A surveillance system was established, and suspected cases were enrolled at five Guinean hospitals. Clinical observations were made, and blood was taken for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay testing and isolation of Lassa virus. Lassa fever was confirmed in 22 (7\%) of 311 suspected cases. Another 43 (14\%) had Lassa IgG antibodies, indicating past exposure. Both sexes and a wide variety of age and ethnic groups were affected. The disease was more frequently found, and the IgG seroprevalence generally higher, in the southeastern forest region. In some areas, there were significant discrepancies between the incidence of Lassa fever and the prevalence of antibody. Clinical presentations between those with Lassa fever and other febrile illnesses were essentially indistinguishable. Clinical predictors of a poor outcome were noted, but again were not specific for Lassa fever. Case-fatality rates for those with Lassa fever and non-Lassa febrile illnesses were 18\% and 15\%, respectively. Seasonal fluctuation in the incidence of Lassa fever was noted, but occurred similarly with non-Lassa febrile illnesses. Our results, perhaps typical of the scenario throughout much of West Africa, indicate Lassa virus infection to be widespread in certain areas of Guinea, but difficult to distinguish clinically.},

  abstract = {Accurate data on the Lassa virus (LASV) human case fatality rate (CFR) and the prevalence of LASV in humans, rodents and other mammals are needed for better planning of actions that will ultimately reduce the burden of LASV infection in sub-Saharan Africa. In this systematic review with meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, Scopus, Africa Journal Online, and African Index Medicus from 1969 to 2020 to obtain studies that reported enough data to calculate LASV infection CFR or prevalence. Study selection, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment were conducted independently. We extracted all measures of current, recent, and past infections with LASV. Prevalence and CFR estimates were pooled using a random-effect meta-analysis. Factors associated with CFR, prevalence, and sources of between-study heterogeneity were determined using subgroup and metaregression analyses. This review was registered with PROSPERO, CRD42020166465. We initially identified 1,399 records and finally retained 109 reports that contributed to 291 prevalence records from 25 countries. The overall CFR was 29.7\% (22.3-37.5) in humans. Pooled prevalence of LASV infection was 8.7\% (95\% confidence interval: 6.8-10.8) in humans, 3.2\% (1.9-4.6) in rodents, and 0.7\% (0.0-2.3) in other mammals. Subgroup and metaregression analyses revealed a substantial statistical heterogeneity explained by higher prevalence in tissue organs, in case-control, in hospital outbreak, and surveys, in retrospective studies, in urban and hospital setting, in hospitalized patients, and in West African countries. This study suggests that LASV infections is an important cause of death in humans and that LASV are common in humans, rodents and other mammals in sub-Saharan Africa. These estimates highlight disparities between sub-regions, and population risk profiles. Western Africa, and specific key populations were identified as having higher LASV CFR and prevalence, hence, deserving more attention for cost-effective preventive interventions.},

  abstract = {Ribavirin is currently the standard of care for treating Lassa fever. However, the human clinical trial data supporting its use suffer from several serious flaws that render the results and conclusions unreliable. We performed a systematic review of available pre-clinical data and human pharmacokinetic data on ribavirin in Lassa. In in-vitro studies, the EC50 of ribavirin ranged from 0.6 {$\mu$}g/ml to 21.72 {$\mu$}g/ml and the EC90 ranged from 1.5 {$\mu$}g/ml to 29 {$\mu$}g/ml. The mean EC50 was 7 {$\mu$}g/ml and the mean EC90 was 15 {$\mu$}g/ml. Human PK data in patients with Lassa fever was sparse and did not allow for estimation of concentration profiles or pharmacokinetic parameters. Pharmacokinetic modelling based on healthy human data suggests that the concentration profiles of current ribavirin regimes only exceed the mean EC50 for less than 20\% of the time and the mean EC90 for less than 10\% of the time, raising the possibility that the current ribavirin regimens in clinical use are unlikely to reliably achieve serum concentrations required to inhibit Lassa virus replication. The results of this review highlight serious issues with the evidence, which, by today standards, would be unlikely to support the transition of ribavirin from pre-clinical studies to human clinical trials. Additional pre-clinical studies are needed before embarking on expensive and challenging clinical trials of ribavirin in Lassa fever., Lassa fever is a viral disease endemic to West Africa that has been highlighted by the World Health Organisation as one of the top ten epidemic threats to global health. Ribavirin has been used to treat Lassa fever for more than 30 years. However, the clinical evidence for ribavirin is poor. We conducted a systematic review of the pre-clinical and human pharmacokinetic data in Lassa. We found that the minimum concentrations of ribavirin that inhibited Lassa virus replication varied hugely according to the experimental design and the type of cell and Lassa virus strain used. There was no comprehensive data on the concentrations of ribavirin in the blood of Lassa fever patients. Modelling of ribavirin concentration data from healthy humans suggest that the doses of ribavirin currently used to treat Lassa fever patients do not reliably achieve the concentrations required to inhibit viral replication.},

  abstract = {Background Lassa fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic disease endemic in Nigeria. The 2018 Lassa fever outbreak in Nigeria was unprecedented, with 8\% of all cases occurring among healthcare workers (HCWs). A disproportionately high number of these infections occurred in HCWs working in a tertiary health facility in Nigeria. This paper describes the cluster of Lassa fever infections among HCWs in a treatment centre and the lessons learnt. Methods We analysed clinical, epidemiological and laboratory data from surveillance and laboratory records kept during the 2018 outbreak. Interviews were conducted with surviving HCWs using a questionnaire developed specifically for the investigation of Lassa fever infections in HCWs. Descriptive analysis of the data was performed in Microsoft excel. Results The index case was a 15-year-old male who presented at the health facility with fever and uncontrolled nasopharyngeal bleeding, following a recent uvulectomy by a traditional healer. Overall, 16 HCWs were affected (15 confirmed and 1 probable) with five deaths (CFR-31.6\%). Of the 15 confirmed cases, five (33.3\%) were asymptomatic. Nine HCWs were direct contacts of the index case; the remaining six HCWs had no direct contact with the index case. HCW interviews identified a low index of suspicion for Lassa fever leading to inadequate infection prevention and control (IPC) practices as possible contributing factors to nosocomial transmission. Conclusion Maintaining a high index of suspicion for Lassa fever in all patients, especially in endemic areas, is essential in adhering to adequate IPC practices in health facilities in order to prevent nosocomial transmission of Lassa fever among HCWs. There is a need to continually train and sensitise HCWs on strict adherence to IPC measures while providing care, irrespective of a patient’s provisional diagnosis.},

  abstract = {Human infectious diseases are a significant threat to global human health and economies (e.g. Ebola, SARs), with the majority of infectious diseases having an animal source (zoonotic). Despite their importance, the lack of a quantitative predictive framework hampers our understanding of how spillovers of zoonotic infectious diseases into the human population will be impacted by global environmental stressors. Here, we create an environmental-mechanistic model for understanding the impact of global change on the probability of zoonotic disease reservoir host--human spillover events. As a case study, we focus on Lassa fever virus (LAS). We first quantify the spatial determinants of LAS outbreaks, including the phylogeographic distribution of its reservoir host Natal multimammate rat (Mastomys natalensis) (LAS host). Secondly, we use these determinants to inform our environmental-mechanistic model to estimate present-day LAS spillover events and the predicted impact of climate change, human population growth and land use by 2070. We find phylogeographic evidence to suggest that LAS is confined to only one clade of LAS host (Western clade Mastomys natalensis) and that the probability of its occurrence was a major determinant of the spatial variation in LAS historical outbreaks (69{$\cdot$}8\%), along with human population density (20{$\cdot$}4\%). Our estimates for present-day LAS spillover events from our environmental-mechanistic model were consistent with observed patterns, and we predict an increase in events per year by 2070 from 195 125 to 406 725 within the LAS endemic western African region. Of the component drivers, climate change and human population growth are predicted to have the largest effects by increasing landscape suitability for the host and human--host contact rates, while land-use change has only a weak impact on the number of future events. LAS spillover events did not respond uniformly to global environmental stressors, and we suggest that understanding the impact of global change on zoonotic infectious disease emergence requires an understanding of how reservoir host species respond to environmental change. Our environmental-mechanistic modelling methodology provides a novel generalizable framework to understand the impact of global change on the spillover of zoonotic diseases.},

  abstract = {Simple Summary Lassa fever is a viral hemorrhagic fever caused by the Lassa virus (LASV). It is a deadly rodent-borne zoonosis with outbreaks occurring mostly in Sierra Leone, Guinea, Liberia, and Nigeria, in West Africa. In Sierra Leone, surveillance activities of LASV focus mainly on the Kenema area in the eastern region, known to be the epicentre. Little is known about the presence of the virus in the Bo area, where Mastomys natalensis and Rattus rattus share habitats with humans. Our study investigated the circulation and phylogeny of new LASV strains and virus seroprevalence in rodent populations of villages in Bo district. Information provided here will be of great importance in prioritizing areas for Lassa fever surveillance and preventive measures to mitigate future outbreaks. Our rodent longitudinal survey carried out over two years (2014-2016) identified Mastomys natalensis as the most prevalent species. While seropositive small mammals were found in every village, the four Mastomys natalensis rodents that tested PCR-positive for Lassa virus were found in only two villages. Phylogenetic analysis showed that these sequences belong to the Sierra Leonean clade, within lineage IV. In conclusion, LASV is present, with low circulation, in small mammals in rural settings around Bo. Lassa fever is a viral hemorrhagic fever caused by the Lassa virus LASV, which was first isolated in the rodent Mastomys natalensis in 1974 in Kenema, Sierra Leone. As little is known about the abundance and the presence of LASV in rodents living in the Bo area, we carried out a small mammal longitudinal population survey. A standardized trapping session was performed in various habitats and seasons in six villages over two years (2014-2016) and samples collected were tested for arenavirus IgG and LASV. A Bayesian phylogenetic analysis was performed on sequences identified by PCR. A total of 1490 small mammals were collected, and 16 rodent species were identified, with M. natalensis (355, 24\%) found to be the most prevalent species. Forty-one (2.8\%) samples were IgG positive, and 31 of these were trapped in homes and 10 in surrounding vegetation. Twenty-nine of 41 seropositive rodents were M. natalensis. We detected four LASV by PCR in two villages, all found in M. natalensis. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the sequences were distributed within the Sierra Leonean clade within lineage IV, distinguishing a Bo sub-clade older than a Kenema sub-clade. Compared to other settings, we found a low abundance of M. natalensis and a low circulation of LASV in rodents in villages around Bo district.},

  abstract = {1. The natal multimammate mouse (Mastomys natalensis) is the primary reservoir host of Lassa mammarenavirus (LASV), a zoonotic pathogen causing Lassa fever that is endemic to West Africa. The occurrence and abundance of this species is regulated by the human environment and biotic interactions with other small-mammal species, but these ecological drivers remain poorly understood in the regions where Lassa fever outbreaks are observed. 2. We developed a Bayesian multi-species occupancy model incorporating incomplete detection to assess habitat use from data obtained as part of a multi-year small-mammal trapping study (43,226 trap nights across four village sites in Sierra Leone, 2020-2023). We investigated the effects of land use gradients and small-mammal community dynamics on the spatial distribution of M. natalensis. 3. Mastomys natalensis occupancy increased along a gradient from forest to agriculture to village habitats but was reduced in peri-urban settings compared to rural settings. Invasive rodent species influenced this pattern, with Mus musculus presence associated with reduced M. natalensis occupancy in peri-urban settings. We did not observe a similar effect when considering the co-occurrence of invasive Rattus rattus with M. natalensis in rural settings. 4. These findings suggest that land use and species interactions drive spatial heterogeneity in M. natalensis populations, potentially explaining reduced Lassa fever incidence in urban areas. The results highlight the importance of considering community dynamics when predicting the risk of outbreaks of endemic zoonoses and the need to widen the context of studies of LASV transmission beyond the primary reservoir host species. 5. To better assess public health risk and improve allocation of limited resources, we recommend more precise characterisation of small-mammal communities in LASV endemic regions, particularly in areas undergoing rapid land use change which may alter community level small-mammal biodiversity.},

Within its invasive range in West Africa,               R. rattus               may compete with the native rodent               Mastomys natalensis               , the primary reservoir host of Lassa virus, a zoonotic pathogen that kills thousands annually. Here, we use rodent trapping data from Sierra Leone and Guinea to show that               R. rattus               presence reduces               M. natalensis               density within the human dwellings where Lassa virus exposure is most likely to occur. Further, we integrate infection data from               M. natalensis               to demonstrate that Lassa virus zoonotic spillover risk is lower at sites with               R. rattus               . While non-native species can have numerous negative effects on ecosystems, our results suggest that               R. rattus               invasion has the indirect benefit of decreasing zoonotic spillover of an endemic pathogen, with important implications for invasive species control across West Africa.},

  abstract = {Lassa fever, caused by Lassa mammarenavirus (LASV), is an endemic zoonosis in several West African countries. Human infections primarily result from transmission from rodent hosts, with the primary reservoir species being Mastomys natalensis , a synanthropic rodent. In Sierra Leone, small-mammal communities are structured along land use gradients, and this structure is hypothesized to influence the risk of Lassa fever outbreaks in human populations. However, whether anthropogenic habitats facilitate significant LASV transmission among small mammals is not well understood. To address this, we conducted rodent sampling over 43,266 trap nights, detecting 684 rodents and shrews in the Lassa fever-endemic Eastern Province of Sierra Leone. We reconstructed small-mammal contact networks to investigate whether contact rates and network structures differed by land use to identify settings more conducive to viral transmission among hosts. We found that small-mammal communities were larger in villages and agricultural settings than in forests, but contact rates were similar across habitats. Network structures differed by land use, with villages exhibiting more disconnected networks compared to agricultural settings. Notably, intra-specific contact among M. natalensis was more likely in agricultural environments than in villages, suggesting that land use can influence LASV transmission dynamics. Overall, LASV seroprevalence was 5.7\% across the small-mammal communities, with LASV antibodies detected in nine rodent and shrew species. These findings underscore the importance of expanding rodent surveillance across various habitats to understand habitat-specific pathogen transmission dynamics. A more systematic approach to LASV surveillance in villages and agricultural settings will help identify key host species driving pathogen dynamics.},

  abstract = {Introduction Zoonotic spillover driven by human activity remains a critical challenge. Research focusing on disease ecology or human–animal interactions provide detailed but often siloed local insights disconnected from global processes and policy. Risk maps are commonly used to inform decisions, yet their connection to local-scale drivers of transmission remains poorly understood. This study bridges these gaps through a cross-scale study of Lassa fever, a rodent-borne hemorrhagic fever of public health significance in West Africa and a WHO priority pathogen. We use a fine-scale quantitative and participatory modelling approach that explicitly integrates into broad-scale risk models to identify the patterns and processes that drive spillover within human-driven ecosystem at the animal-human interface. Lassa Fever epidemics are dominated by endemic and seasonal spillover of Mammarenavirus lassaense (LASV) from rodent reservoirs to humans within a rural context, positioning LASV as a uniquely tractable system in which to study spillover. Methods and Analysis We are currently conducting parallel observational studies of humans, rodents, and landscapes explicitly designed to feed into a cross-scale quantitative modelling framework. By integrating data on landcover, rodent dynamics, human behavior, and LASV infection, we examine how anthropogenic activities shape LASV ecology and human exposure. These data will inform spatial models of the human-rodent-LASV interface to predict key drivers of exposure risk. Finally, we integrate data from our empirical studies and emergent patterns from our interface model(s) into an existing broad-scale regression-based risk model. Our local-scale study and model predictions will clarify how zoonotic risk propagates from local to regional scales, providing evidence to inform disease management efforts for Lassa fever, and zoonotic spillover more generally. Ethics and dissemination Human subjects and animal research approvals were obtained from multiple ethical review boards, including the National Health Research Ethics Committee and National Veterinary Research Institute in Nigeria. The research protocol adheres to principles of ethical community-based health research including fostering collaboration, enhancing transparency, supporting capacity building, and disseminating results to communities and public health authorities. ● Interdisciplinary approach: Integrates ecological, epidemiological, and anthropological methodologies for a comprehensive understanding of LASV dynamics.● Predictive modeling: Utilizes modeling techniques to integrate diverse data sets, offering valuable insights for mechanistic understanding, forecasting, and intervention planning.● Community engagement: Emphasizes ethical practices and active involvement of local communities, ensuring culturally sensitive research, guiding subsequent intervention design and enhancing data relevance.● Geographical focus: Conducted in Nigeria within West Africa, a region critically affected by LASV, addressing a significant gap in current research and informing public health strategies.● Complexity of integrating diverse data sets: Conceptual challenges in effectively integrating data from varied disciplines, which may require novel, integrative methodologies.● Scaling local studies to regional interpretations of hotspots: Unknown capacity of geographically restricted, fine-scale data collections to make broader scale generalizations in risk modelling.● Dependence on external factors: External factors such as political and economic stability, accessibility of remote areas, and public health policies might impact the study’s execution and outcomes.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               Despite large outbreaks in humans seeming improbable for a number of zoonotic pathogens, several pose a concern due to their epidemiological characteristics and evolutionary potential. To enable effective responses to these pathogens in the event that they undergo future emergence, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations is advancing the development of vaccines for several pathogens prioritized by the World Health Organization. A major challenge in this pursuit is anticipating demand for a vaccine stockpile to support outbreak response.                                         Methods               We developed a modeling framework for outbreak response for emerging zoonoses under three reactive vaccination strategies to assess sustainable vaccine manufacturing needs, vaccine stockpile requirements, and the potential impact of the outbreak response. This framework incorporates geographically variable zoonotic spillover rates, human-to-human transmission, and the implementation of reactive vaccination campaigns in response to disease outbreaks. As proof of concept, we applied the framework to four priority pathogens: Lassa virus, Nipah virus, MERS coronavirus, and Rift Valley virus.                                         Results                                Annual vaccine regimen requirements for a population-wide strategy ranged from {$>$} 670,000 (95\% prediction interval 0--3,630,000) regimens for Lassa virus to 1,190,000 (95\% PrI 0--8,480,000) regimens for Rift Valley fever virus, while the regimens required for ring vaccination or targeting healthcare workers (HCWs) were several orders of magnitude lower (between 1/25 and 1/700) than those required by a population-wide strategy. For each pathogen and vaccination strategy, reactive vaccination typically prevented fewer than 10\% of cases, because of their presently low                 R                 0                 values. Targeting HCWs had a higher per-regimen impact than population-wide vaccination.                                                        Conclusions               Our framework provides a flexible methodology for estimating vaccine stockpile needs and the geographic distribution of demand under a range of outbreak response scenarios. Uncertainties in our model estimates highlight several knowledge gaps that need to be addressed to target vulnerable populations more accurately. These include surveillance gaps that mask the true geographic distribution of each pathogen, details of key routes of spillover from animal reservoirs to humans, and the role of human-to-human transmission outside of healthcare settings. In addition, our estimates are based on the current epidemiology of each pathogen, but pathogen evolution could alter vaccine stockpile requirements.},

  abstract = {Background               Lassa fever (LF) is an acute viral hemorrhagic disease endemic to West Africa that has been declared a priority disease by the World Health Organization due to its severity and the lack of a vaccine or effective treatment options. Several candidate vaccines are currently in development and are expected to be ready for phase III field efficacy trials soon. However, most LF cases and deaths are believed to go unreported, and as a result we lack a clear understanding of several aspects of LF epidemiology and immunology that are critical to the design of vaccine efficacy trials.                                         Methods                                To help guide vaccine trial design and trial site selection we estimated the force of infection (FOI) from rodent hosts to humans in all 1                 st                 and 2                 nd                 administrative units in West Africa from published seroprevalence studies. We next estimated LF reporting probabilities using these FOI estimates and LF case and death reports and then projected FOI in all admin1 and admin2 areas without seroprevalence data. We then extrapolated age-specific LF incidence rates from FOI estimates under different assumptions regarding the level of protection against reinfection among seropositive and seronegative individuals with a history of prior infection.                                                        Results               Projected FOI estimates and modeled annual LF incidence rates indicate that Sierra Leone, southern Guinea, and a few areas within Nigeria would likely experience the highest LF case incidence rates for a vaccine trial. Estimated LF incidence rates were highly sensitive to assumptions about Lassa immunology, particularly the frequency of seroreversion among previously infected individuals and the extent to which seroreverted individuals retain protection against reinfection and more severe disease outcomes.                                         Conclusions               Our spatial LF incidence rate estimates, along with the interannual and seasonal variability in these estimates and estimates of baseline seroprevalence, could be used for vaccine trial site selection, choosing the target population (e.g., age and serostatus), and maximizing a trial's statistical power.},

Despite growing interest from the global health community, the overall disease burden remains poorly understood due to persistent underreporting and inadequate diagnostic capacities. This study aimed to assess LASV infection dynamics in rural Guinea, addressing gaps in understanding its epidemiology in endemic settings.                                                Methods                  A cross-sectional serosurveillance study was conducted across 6 villages in Faranah, Guinea, involving 1306 participants. Serum samples were analyzed for LASV-specific antibodies using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and a subset confirmed via immunofluorescence and neutralization assays. Statistical and mathematical models were used to estimate key epidemiological parameters, including the force of infection, antibody waning rates, and infection prevalence.                                                Results                  Overall, IgG seroprevalence was 82.3\%, while IgM prevalence stood at 1.8\%. Seroprevalence of IgG exceeded 50\% by age 5 and increased steadily with age, indicating lifelong exposure. Antibody waning rates suggested an average IgG persistence of 58 years. Mathematical analysis showed that halving LASV prevalence would require a 10-fold reduction in the force of spillover, highlighting the challenges of effective control measures.                                                Conclusions                  The seroprevalence observed in this study was markedly higher than reported elsewhere in West Africa, identifying Faranah as a hotspot for LASV transmission. Despite the high seroprevalence and estimated force of infection, the number of reported acute cases is very low, suggesting that LASV may frequently cause pauci- or asymptomatic infections or be commonly misdiagnosed for other diseases. These findings underscore that LASV is more widespread than assumed in rural Guinea.},
